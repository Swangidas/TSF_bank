# TSF_bank
Hello Everyone,

This was my project while I was interning for The Sparks Foundation #GRIPAUG21.
I have completed my Task1 on Web Development:
The task was to create a simple dynamic Banking website with creating dummy data in the database for up to 10 customers. The customer's table would have basic fields such as name, email, current balance, etc. The transfers table would record all transfers that happened.
I have successfully completed the above-mentioned task.
The Technologies used were: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
